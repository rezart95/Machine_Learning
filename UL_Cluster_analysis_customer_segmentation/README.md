As for our project for the first block of the Unsupervised Learning classes, we decided to perform cluster
analysis on a customer segmentation problem. For that we used dataset containing data about the usage
behaviour of about 9000 active credit card holders, available at Kaggle.
For the purposes of our project we also repurposed code from classes as well as taken some inspiration and
suggestions in terms of techniques used, from similar projects based on this dataset.
