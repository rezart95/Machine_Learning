```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = T)
```

## R Markdown
inscription of a project. 

Installing and running the libraries:
```{r echo=T,results='hide',message=FALSE}
requiredPackages = c("tidyverse","factoextra","stats","clustertend","flexclust",
                     "fpc","cluster","ClusterR","knitr","kableExtra") 
for(i in requiredPackages){if(!require(i,character.only = TRUE)) install.packages(i)} 
for(i in requiredPackages){library(i,character.only = TRUE)} 
```

Loading the data:
```{r}
data_full <- read.csv("/Users/rafalelpassion/Unsupervised-Learning2019Z/Dataset/CC GENERAL.csv")
```

```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(data_full),caption = "Summary statistics of the dataset")%>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options="scale_down")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
